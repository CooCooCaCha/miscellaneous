# Miscellaneous

Various utility scripts I've written that do not warrant their own individual repositories. These scripts may be incomplete and/or broken.

beatport_renamer.py - Extracts metadata from songs downloaded from beatport.com and rename them using a custom format.  

bitcoin_bot.py - Analyze bitcoin price data retrieved from bitstamp.  

hashword.py - Password generator and manager. Doesn't really do much right now other than randomly generating passwords using SHA-512.
